Make a post on social media particular LinkedIn to clone this repo and make a change on the application page. It x1is very similar to the application process that was done by Microsoft when they were looking for UX designers people would make small updates to the page. I'm gonna make this look just like a blank HTML page and getting pulled request. Would be an interesting experiment if I was able to pull it off one way that it was able to pull off is that there was a job position and there was Microsoft behind it so that will be a harde kind of pull to make that work but if possible, that would be fantastic. This must be a time event.
